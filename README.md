# Flutter Bloc Snek

A snake game written with Flutter. Displays nicely how to use streams and bloc ancestor widgets to handle state updates.

Also somewhat of a performance test of updates and button feedback once the snek starts moving quicker.

Try playing with collisions off for more casual gameplay, until you become a beam of pure snek.
